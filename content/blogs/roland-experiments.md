## The Oxi sessions
I recorded this back in the summer using the Oxi One to drive the Roland S1 and resulted in some interesting ideas emerging from the mix. The best one was what became Borealis, now vailable on Soundcloud.

I quite like Samply by the way, a great tool building little Audio players like this one.
