The year has flown by really fast and I feel like I haven't done an awful lot with this blog. The original plan I had was to move away from the platforms I commonly use and take more of a "digital garden" approach, to escape the so-called "Walled Gardens" operated by the billionaires of our world.

One great way of making these changes are to embrace the Web 3 projects, such as Hive and Bitcoin.

The track below is hosted on a platform called [Wavlake](https://wavlake.com), have a listen to the track and then read my thoughts and ideas for future forays into this space as a result of getting a lot more out of this than I typically do from Spotify etc.
# WavLake
Since this site is built using Astro, I chose to build  a new component to support Wavlake content directly from within my blog, which is VERY cool as I have recently been posting tracks on there in order to earn some Sats! I have not only really earned, some very quickly too, thus the barrier to entry is nice and low, I have also had this track [featured on a Podcast](https://fountain.fm/episode/VqiUAVR0zoI5V3gaXGJz), second track, I was delighted with this, have already received royalties from this play.

I have [other tracks on Wavlake](https://wavlake.com/nick-eb-lewis) and will be adding more in the future!
