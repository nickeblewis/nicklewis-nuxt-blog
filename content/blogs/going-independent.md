This year I plan to build more, to create at least one website, this one especially - that helps me explore the latest web technologies, to keep up with my peers. We all spend a lot of time online and I feel that I should start to move away from corporate platforms for blogging and forge my own. Rather than endlessly waste (harsh) time scrolling through Substack content etc, that time could be better sent engineering features for this site, to feed new found knowledge into the open source community.

I know of a few things I'd like to explore and some protocols, technologies that I'd love to integrate with this website but first I need to spec these out, what they are, why I wish to integrate them and how to go about it. What will the benefits be for doing so?
